# ACRA-Android-PHP-backend
An ACRA backend that allows you to view and save to an SQL database on your Android device!

This app is designed to gather the crash logs you receive from the server and save them into a local SQL database. The server component is bundled in /server/, and the app code is stored here. The server component is not run on an Android device. It is run on a server(with PHP).
